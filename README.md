# Trust as a Mediator: Community Context and Political Tolerance in America
A data science project examining whether generalized social trust mediates the relationship between urban-rural residence and political tolerance using General Social Survey (GSS) data.

## Research Question
Does generalized social trust mediate the relationship between urban-rural residence and political tolerance among American adults?

## Overview
Political tolerance—the willingness to extend civil liberties to ideologically opposed groups—is fundamental to democratic functioning. This project investigates why Americans living in different types of communities (urban vs. rural) exhibit varying levels of political tolerance. Specifically, I test whether generalized social trust acts as a psychological mechanism that explains this relationship. 

## Why This Matters
- Addresses growing concerns about political polarization and geographic sorting in America
- Tests specific theoretical mechanisms (rather than just documenting correlations)
- Provides insights for interventions aimed at strengthening democratic norms
- Demonstrates mediation analysis techniques applicable to product analytics, behavioral research, and policy evaluation
