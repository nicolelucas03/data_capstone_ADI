How have Americans' political discussion networks changed over the last 15 years, and do algorithmic personalization and perceived social identity threat mediate the relationship between social media and network homogenization? 

## Overview
This project examines the evolution of political disuccion networks in the United States from 2010 to 2025, with a focus on understanding the role of social media platforms and perceived social threats in shaping who Americans talk to about politics. Using large-scale survey data and advanced statistical methods, I analyzed whether and how digital communication technologies have contributed to increasing political polarization through changes in interpersonal networks. 

## Key Objectives 
1. Document temporal trends in discussion network composition and homogeneity (2010-2025)
2. Test mediation pathways linking social medai usage to network homogenization
3. Identifying moderating factors such as demographic characteristics and political engagement
4. Provide empirical evidence for theories of digital echo chambers and filter bubbles
